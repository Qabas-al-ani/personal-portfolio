# Personal portfolio  

This is my personal portfolio that I created by using the HTML and CSS and I also included media Query functions in my CSS to support all devices.

## Technologies: 

* HTML, I used the html to write the structure of my web page.
* CSS, I used the CSS to style my web page and give it some nice looking by adding colors.

## Editors:

* [Microsoft VS CODE:](  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ ) it’s an awesome code editor.
* [Nodepad++]( https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ ) it’s very helpful code editor that am using all the time plus it’s very light weight.
 
## Validator: 

*	[HTML Validator:]( https://validator.w3.org/ ) I used it to be sure that my code has no errors.
*	[CSS validator:](  https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ ) also I used it to be sure that my code has no errors.
